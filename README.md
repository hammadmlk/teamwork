# Hello Duniya!

This work will gradually evolve into a web browser based distributed computing system.

The system consists of three parts:
- **Workers**: These are volunteers that run the function sent by the server.
- **TaskGivers**: These are clients who request the server to get their job done. 
- **Server**: takes jobs from TaskGivers and distribute them to volunteers. Server also logs progress. 
* for now peer to peer communication is ignored.
