# Hello Duniya!

This work will gradually evolve into a web browser based distributed computing system.



The system consists of two parts:
- Workers: These are volunteers that run the function sent by the server.
- TaskGivers: These are clients who request the server to get their job done. 
- Server: takes jobs from TaskGivers and distribute them to volunteers. Server also logs progress.
